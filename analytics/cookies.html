                        technologies when you visit our websites, products, and services (collectively, the
                        “Services”). It also explains the choices available to you when deciding how we use these

                    <p>
                        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They
                        allow us to remember your actions and preferences so that you have a smoother experience each
                        time you return.

                    <p>
                        These cookies are necessary for our Services to function properly. They enable features such
                        as secure login, account management, and shopping cart functionality.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Performance cookies collect information about how you interact with our Services, helping us
                        monitor system performance, improve load times, and understand what content is most helpful.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Functional cookies allow us to deliver a more personalized experience by remembering your
                        preferences, such as language choices and saved dashboards.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Targeting and Advertising Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        These cookies are used by us and our advertising partners to deliver relevant advertisements
                        and to measure their effectiveness. They help ensure that marketing is useful rather than
                        repetitive.

                    <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                    <p>
                        We partner with trusted third parties—including analytics providers, advertising networks,
                        and social media platforms—who may set cookies when you interact with our Services. These
                        partners have their own privacy policies, and we recommend reviewing them to understand how
                        they handle your information.

                    <h2>How to Manage Cookies</h2>
                    <p>
                        You can control cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to block or
                        delete cookies, but doing so may impact your experience or prevent certain features from
                        working correctly. For more detailed guidance, consult your browser’s help documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are located in regions where cookie consent is required, our Services provide you with
                        in-product controls to update your preferences at any time.

                    <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature. Because there is no universally accepted
                        standard for interpreting DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. If standards
                        emerge, we will revisit this policy.

                    <p>
                        We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in technology, law, or our business. When
                        we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Significant changes
                        may also be communicated through our Services or by email.
